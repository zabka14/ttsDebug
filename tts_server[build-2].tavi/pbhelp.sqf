hint "Here's how to play paintball correctly\n \n
Split you and your friends into even teams\n
The best way to different the teams is to have everyone on a team carry the same paintball gun and have the opposing team carry another type of gun\n
Choose a field to play on\n
Each team should be standing inside the yellow box at their end of the field and should be facing the net with the barrel of their gun in the net so they have to turn around when the match begins\n
No player on either team should be facing the other team or should be outside of the yellow box before the round begins. That would make the game unfair\n
A team wins by eliminating all of the members of the opposing team\n
Players that have already been shot should not enter the field again until the round is over\n
Having a designated unarmed referee to keep score and keep things organized makes things much easier\n

READ THE PAINTBALL FIELD RULES! They can be found on the website and also on the sign in the paintball shop\n

Have fun!\n
